hardest feeling in the world is when you're not reciprocated.
i felt my veins rupture one by one
when i heard you say you had enough.
it boiled on my chest,
left a burning ball of flesh on my ribcage
excrutiatingly crushing my insides.
screaming blood, guilt, and regret.
and it breaks me more the moment i understood
that i can't tell you where and how it hurts
i know you never thought of being subtle
not even being considerate with your words.
so i found it unfair
that i gave you all i ever had.
but the moment you decide it's nice to keep your peace small,
you burn my clothes while i'm in it
hoping to get rid of everything i've been
you left while my skin melts into coal
like you did, few nights before.
i thought i was safe when i told you my world is not a dangerous place,
but the moment i let you in, is the moment i lost everything.
and the more i try to tell that i need your help,
the more you toss me away like i was nothing.
